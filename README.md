# Context

[`Mindustry`](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) mod, made by `Alstin112`, with help of `Flintyx`.

## Description

This mod was created to assist modders and is a remake of the original mod
[Testers](https://github.com/sk7725/Testers) by **sk7725**, featuring some
improvements and new features.

This is my first mod, and the while the graphical parts are not the best,
I would love to learn how to use Mindutry's UI better. if you guys have some
tutorial or guides, please share them with my discord: `Alstin112`.

Some concepts and textures were created with help of FlinTyX.
## Features

### Blocks

Adds **5** new sandbox blocks to the game, with many more planned.

- **JS Tester**:  A block that opens a GUI for testing JavaScript code.
- **Draw Tester**: A block that executes your JavaScript code every frame.
- **Effect Tester**: A block for creating custom effects.
- **Icon Dictionary**: A dictionary block that holds all the icons in the game
(ASCII icons, Mindustry content icons, and Mindustry image icons).
- **Function Analyzer**: A block to help understand the game's interpolation
system and create your own custom interpolations.

### UI

All testers feature a UI that aids in code creation. This UI can synchronize with
real files on your desktop, allowing you to program Mindustry code using VS Code.

### Search Bar

A search bar acts as a "mini console" that lets you search for classes, fields,
and methods, with an option to navigate directly to the documentation.
